## üéØ **RAPID ALIGNMENT PROTOCOLS**

### **5-Minute Context Rebuild**
```
If starting session with time pressure:

1. READ (2 minutes):
   - CURRENT-STATUS.md for immediate context
   - Last session completion report

2. VALIDATE (1 minute):
   - Current working directory
   - Last modified files  
   - Any running services

3. CONFIRM (1 minute):
   - Immediate task is clear
   - Success criteria understood
   - Tools/files needed identified

4. START (1 minute):
   - Begin implementation
```

### **15-Minute Deep Context Rebuild**
```
For complex sessions requiring full context:

1. VISION REFRESH (5 minutes):
   - Read relevant sections of master plan
   - Review agent specialization requirements
   - Confirm understanding of current phase goals

2. TECHNICAL STATE (5 minutes):
   - Review current implementation files
   - Check service status (if applicable)
   - Understand recent changes and their impact

3. PLANNING (3 minutes):
   - Identify session goals
   - Define success criteria
   - Plan implementation approach

4. VALIDATION (2 minutes):
   - Confirm alignment with master plan
   - Verify approach fits agent specialization vision
   - Check for any conflicts or dependencies
```

## üîß **MAINTENANCE TASKS**

### **Weekly Maintenance**
```
Every 5-7 sessions, perform:

‚ñ° Update CURRENT-STATUS.md with latest progress
‚ñ° Review alignment with master plan milestones
‚ñ° Update phase completion percentage
‚ñ° Document any architecture decisions made
‚ñ° Review and update immediate priorities
```

### **Phase Transition Maintenance**
```
When completing each phase:

‚ñ° Complete final phase validation checklist
‚ñ° Document lessons learned
‚ñ° Update master plan if needed (rare)
‚ñ° Set up context for next phase
‚ñ° Celebrate milestone completion! üéâ
```

## üéä **SESSION SUCCESS PATTERNS**

### **High-Impact Session Characteristics**
1. **Clear Starting Context**: Knows exactly where we left off
2. **Specific Goals**: Concrete deliverables, not vague improvements
3. **Alignment Validation**: Regular checks against master plan
4. **Progress Documentation**: Always documents what was accomplished
5. **Next Session Setup**: Leaves clear context for continuation

### **Session Anti-Patterns to Avoid**
1. **Vague Restart**: "Continue working on the AI project"
2. **Context Amnesia**: Not reviewing current state before starting
3. **Scope Creep**: Adding features not aligned with master plan
4. **Undocumented Progress**: Not recording what was accomplished
5. **Broken Continuity**: Starting new directions without context

## üöÄ **SAMPLE SESSION STARTERS**

### **Example 1: Architecture Session**
```
I'm Mohit, continuing development of my Personal AI Brain project. Please review:
- /Users/mohit/claude/claude-code/langgraph-orchestrator/docs/strategy/00-MASTER-PLAN.md
- /Users/mohit/claude/claude-code/langgraph-orchestrator/CURRENT-STATUS.md

CURRENT PHASE: Phase 1, Week 2 - Multi-Agent Framework
IMMEDIATE FOCUS: Implementing agent-to-agent communication system

The goal is to enable the Personal Assistant agent to coordinate with the Data Analyst agent for complex queries that require both coordination and analysis.

Please confirm understanding and let's continue building the multi-agent communication framework.
```

### **Example 2: Integration Session**  
```
I'm Mohit, continuing my Personal AI Brain development. Please review the master plan and current status:
- /Users/mohit/claude/claude-code/langgraph-orchestrator/docs/strategy/00-MASTER-PLAN.md

CURRENT PHASE: Phase 2, Week 3 - Core Agents
IMMEDIATE FOCUS: Testing HR Director agent with Slack and Google Workspace integration

I need to validate that the HR Director agent can handle employee-related queries using the appropriate MCP services with the right empathetic personality.

Ready to continue with HR Director agent testing?
