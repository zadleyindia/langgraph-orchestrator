Mohit: "How many GitHub issues are open?"
→ Dev Lead Agent
→ GitHub MCP query
→ "Mohit, you have 23 open issues, 8 are high priority"
```

### **Multi-Agent Collaboration**
```
Complex Request → Personal Assistant Coordinates → Multiple Agents Execute → Consolidated Response

Example:
Mohit: "Prepare for quarterly board meeting"
→ Personal Assistant coordinates:
  → Data Analyst: Q3 performance report
